# Support-Vector-Machine---SVM

Overview:
This project is an implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification tasks. Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. In this project, I have utilized the SVM algorithm to build a model that can classify data points into different classes based on their features.

Features:
SVM Implementation: The core of this project is the implementation of the Support Vector Machine algorithm from scratch.
Classification: The SVM model is trained to classify data points into predefined categories.
Hyperparameter Tuning: I have explored different hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the SVM model.
Evaluation Metrics: Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of the SVM model.
Visualization: Visualizations are provided to illustrate the decision boundary and the separation of classes achieved by the SVM model.
